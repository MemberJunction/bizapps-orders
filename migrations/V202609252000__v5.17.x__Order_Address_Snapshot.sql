-- V202609252000 — Keep each order's customer address as it was at the time of
-- sale (bc-aidp-next-golive#263)
-- =============================================================================
-- OrderHeader.BillToAddressID, ShipToAddressID and OrderLine.ShipToAddressID
-- point at live __mj_BizAppsCommon.Address rows, and the address editors save
-- onto the same row. Where the customer was on the date of sale decides which
-- state the sale counts in, so editing an address after a customer moves moved
-- every earlier sale to the new state. Record Changes keeps the old values, but
-- nothing downstream reads them.
--
-- What this file does:
--   1. OrderHeader.BillToAddressSnapshot / ShipToAddressSnapshot and
--      OrderLine.ShipToAddressSnapshot: the address as JSON, written by
--      OrderEntityServer on the first transition to Confirmed. NULL until then.
--   2. Backfills the snapshots of orders that are already Confirmed.
--   3. trg_OrderHeader_AddressFrozenAfterConfirm (51015) and
--      trg_OrderLine_AddressFrozenAfterConfirm (51016). On a Confirmed order an
--      address that is set cannot change, and an address that is empty may be
--      filled once, together with its snapshot. A snapshot that has been
--      written never changes, on any order.
--
-- SET-ONCE, NOT STRICTLY FROZEN, for the same reason as the bill-to party in
-- trg_OrderHeader_ImmutableAfterConfirm: an order can be confirmed before its
-- address is known, and recording where the sale went later does not rewrite
-- it. A snapshot may likewise be written on a Confirmed order that has none,
-- which is how an order confirmed before this migration, or created Confirmed
-- by the data conversion and booked afterwards, gets one.
--
-- These are separate triggers rather than more clauses on
-- trg_OrderHeader_ImmutableAfterConfirm and trg_OrderLine_ImmutableAfterConfirm,
-- so this file does not have to restate those triggers' bodies and cannot undo
-- a change another migration makes to them.
--
-- RUN CODEGEN AFTER THIS so vwOrderHeaders, vwOrderLines, the CRUD procs and the
-- entity subclasses pick the columns up.

-- Judged by the PRIOR status (deleted.Status), so the confirming UPDATE itself,
-- which writes the snapshots, passes. On a Confirmed order:
--   · an address that is set may not be replaced or cleared;
--   · an empty address may be filled only in the same write as its snapshot, so
--     a confirmed order never names an address it has no record of.
-- The last two conditions do not depend on status: a snapshot that is already
-- written is final even if the order's status were moved by direct SQL.
--
-- Nullable columns are compared with EXISTS / EXCEPT, which treats two NULLs as
-- equal and a NULL against a value as a change.
