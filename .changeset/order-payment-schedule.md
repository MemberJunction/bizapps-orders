Payment schedules on the order header (golive #239, plan D85–D88, W1/W4–W8). New `OrderHeaderPaymentSchedule` table: one row per instalment with a stamped `CompanyID`, its own `AmountPaid`/`Balance` rollup, and invoice identity (`DocumentNumber`, `InvoicedAt`, `InvoicedByUserID`, `JournalEntryID`) frozen at invoicing; `ExternalSystem`/`ExternalInvoiceRef`/`SentAt` for the outbound integration to write. `PaymentLine.OrderHeaderPaymentScheduleID` aims a payment at one instalment; unnamed payments cascade oldest-due-first. `vwOrderHeaders` gains `NextDueDate` and `IsOverdue` ages on it. New operations `Orders.IssueInstalmentInvoice` (freeze number, stamp, advance; idempotent; calls the AR-reclass seam AIDP-25 fills) and `Orders.GetBillingWorklist` (instalments due with no invoice), with a Billing worklist page on the Receivables rail. Confirm refuses a schedule that does not tie to the lines, naming the shortfall. Per-instalment invoice documents via `PaymentScheduleID` on `Orders.GenerateInvoice`. An order with no schedule behaves exactly as before.
