  - @mj-biz-apps/orders-entities@5.8.0

## 5.7.0

### Minor Changes

- bbb5171: OrdersEngine now caches Products, Product Prices, Product Categories, Product Types, Subscription Types, and Revenue Recognition Types (@RegisterForStartup). Confirm, pricing, checkout, fulfilment, and the catalog picker read those arrays instead of per-call RunView. Confirm looks up rev-rec types by normalized ID and inherits ProductType.DefaultRevenueRecognitionTypeID when the product left it blank. GL Account Roles stay on AccountingEngineBase; booking no longer force-refreshes that cache. Confirm also inherits ProductType.DefaultSubscriptionTypeID when the product left SubscriptionTypeID blank. `@mj-biz-apps/accounting-engine-base` is a real dependency of orders-core-entities-server (static import, declared in package.json), not a peer. Local filter-eval helpers are PascalCase (`EvaluateFilter`, `IsCompositeFilter`, `ParseFilterField`). Order-line price override is a pencil that expands a named-price picker (custom amount only when Custom is selected) plus Override Explanation when the price diverges from default. OrderLine gains PriceOverridden and PriceOverrideReason. Ship/bill addresses bind AddressID from the party; custom addresses can be linked onto the person/org profile.

### Patch Changes

- a436049: License declarations now agree on BUSL-1.1 everywhere.

  The manifest was corrected earlier; the README badge still advertised ISC, which is the
  first license statement a reader meets and outranked `LICENSE`, `package.json`,
  `mj-app.json` and every workspace package in practice. The badge now reads BUSL-1.1 and
  links to `LICENSE`.

## 5.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e48bc43: Stop the order Balance rendering as a dash, and stop it erasing itself (bc-aidp-next-golive#186).

  `TotalGross`, `AmountPaid`, `Balance` and `FulfillmentStatus` on `OrderHeader` are maintained by
  `spRecalcOrderHeaderTotals`, which the OrderLine and PaymentLine triggers fire. On a
  create-and-confirm the header is written before any line exists, so `Balance` is legitimately NULL
  at that moment — and `OrderEntityServer.Save()` never read the refreshed row back onto the entity.
  `SaveEntityGraphOperation` returns `root.GetAll()`, so the browser adopted that NULL, and
  `FormatMoney` renders NULL as an em-dash. A confirmed, unpaid $895 order therefore reported its
  balance as `—`, which in that formatter means "not computed", not "nothing owed".

  The stored value did not survive either. Every SP-parameter field is sent on the next update
  regardless of dirty state, and a nullable column carrying NULL emits `@<Col>_Clear=1`, which
  `spUpdateOrderHeader` obeys by writing NULL over the trigger's value; a stale `AmountPaid = 0` needs
  no flag at all to overwrite a captured payment. So editing anything on a confirmed order erased its
  totals — the figures payment allocation and the aging report read.

  - `OrderEntityServer` now adopts the row's rollups before `Save()` returns, on the full path (after
    lines, payments, entitlements, inside the transaction) and on the header-only shortcut, where the
    refresh exists to overwrite whatever the caller believed about those four columns before the
    update is sent.
  - The merge rule moved to `OrderRollupBehavior` and is explicit that the ROW wins, including when it
    reports NULL: a row saying "not computed yet" is more current than an entity's leftover figure.
  - The order form's Balance and Paid tiles no longer return a bare dash for a record that exists.
    `AmountPaid` is NOT NULL, and the balance falls back to the pricing preview's total less anything
    paid, so an unsaved draft shows real figures instead of two dashes.
  - `V202609021530__v0.1.x__Repair_OrderHeader_Rollups.sql` re-derives `TotalGross`, `AmountPaid` and
    `Balance` from lines and captured payments for the rows that disagree with them, repairing orders
    already erased. It deliberately leaves `FulfillmentStatus` alone: that column has unrelated drift
    from never being backfilled when it was added, and correcting it inside a money repair would
    quietly change what the fulfilment queue shows.

### Minor Changes

- c724132: Add CheckoutWidget, CheckoutWidgetDistribution, and CheckoutSession entities, embedded checkout widget component, and session management with atomic Compare-and-Swap state transitions and identity claiming.
- 44944fd: Add the entitlement read contract: `Orders.CheckEntitlement` and `Orders.ListEntitlements` evaluate in-force access (status + window + subscription access-through) instead of polling `EntitlementGrant.Status`. Cancel now revokes standing grants when access-through has already passed.

### Patch Changes

- e21ad46: Host the Angular checkout widget as an Angular Element on `GET /checkout/:slug`, retrieve Stripe intent status on complete (localhost has no webhook), skip a second confirmCardPayment when the intent already succeeded, and book `Orders.CapturePayment` after confirm so AmountPaid / PaymentHeader land without waiting for Stripe to POST. Stripe Capture treats an already-captured automatic-capture intent as success.
- 07e0b10: Checkout hardening wave: fix the blocking defects and ship the anonymous edge.

  Defect fixes in CheckoutSessionService:

  - The payer Person is now resolved (find-or-create by the session's captured email) at
    completion and stamped onto the session and the order's BillTo/ShipTo — previously every
    widget order failed OrderHeaderEntity.Validate() with no customer.
  - A session acquires a payment intent through the new OpenPaymentIntentForSession (amount
    from the session's server-priced snapshot, provider from the widget's Configuration
    paymentProviderId); the completion gate now verifies the intent's STATE (Succeeded, as
    advanced by the signature-verified webhook) and that its amount covers the re-priced
    total — mere existence of an intent id no longer books an order.
  - The GuestOrder claim mint uses the real IdentityClaimEngineServer import (the previous
    MJGlobal.ClassRegistry duck-type was dead code) and passes the entity GUID.
  - EntitlementGrantClaimDriver.OnRevoke stamps RevokedAt + RevocationReason (the generated
    validation rule rejected Revoked-without-RevokedAt, so revocations silently no-oped) and
    failures are logged instead of swallowed; OnExpire logs failed saves.

  Session hardening:

  - ClientSessionKey is re-verified (constant-time) on every mutating call; ExpiresAt is
    enforced past initialization (expired sessions transition to Expired); completion is
    replay-safe (a Confirmed session returns its existing order) and never reverts to Open
    once the order has committed; server-side quantity/line caps apply when unconfigured;
    hand-rolled SQL escaping replaced with the sql-guards helpers; secret-shaped keys are
    stripped from the Configuration returned to anonymous callers; Person rows are no longer
    minted on the draft path; the platform-specific GETUTCDATE() filter is now portable.

  The anonymous checkout edge (new):

  - CheckoutServerExtension (DriverClass 'OrdersCheckoutEdge') mounts pre-auth REST routes
    POST /checkout/{initialize,draft,payment-intent,complete} via the serverExtensions
    mechanism, with fail-closed gates: body cap, per-IP(+slug) rate limiting, per-widget
    origin allowlist (Configuration.allowedOrigins) with scoped CORS grants, and optional
    Cloudflare Turnstile (Configuration.requireTurnstile + Settings.TurnstileSecretEnvVar).
    Writes run as the configured ServiceUserEmail principal (system-user fallback). The
    claim-driver Load anchors are now called from LoadBizAppsOrdersServer so the drivers
    survive tree-shaking.

- 844f85d: Public checkout URL is `GET /checkout/:slug` on the existing `OrdersCheckoutEdge` (vanilla HTML talking to the POST edge). The server package publishes `MJ_SERVER_EXTENSIONS` (and `package.json` `memberjunction.serverExtensions`) so a host that lists `@mj-biz-apps/orders-server` in `dynamicPackages.server[]` auto-loads the webhook and checkout edge. Initialize writes a SKU-resolved `productId` onto Configuration so that page can draft a line.
- c490929: Checkout follow-up from the #115/#116 security review: fail-closed open catalog without widget CompanyID; do not serve the element source map on the public payment route unless opted in; book CapturePayment from payment_intent.succeeded (including AlreadyApplied retries); require a CSP nonce on the host page renderer.
- d8d94c7: Declare `@mj-biz-apps/tasks-entities` as a type-only optional peer (devDependency + optional peerDependency). The import is `import type`, so hosts without bizapps-tasks must not be forced to install it.
- ce76550: Type the checkout-capture terminal Task through `@mj-biz-apps/tasks-entities` (typed `TypeID`/`Name`/`Status` setters and TaskType.ID getter) instead of untyped `.Set()` / `.Get()`.
- cf88598: Resolve the GENERAL TaskType by Code before raising a checkout-capture terminal Task, so TypeID is set and the row can save.
- f426462: Classify checkout CapturePayment webhook failures: terminal refusals (and events older than 12h) return 200 plus a `[CHECKOUT-CAPTURE-TERMINAL]` marker so Stripe does not retry for three days; transient failures still 500. Stripe `created` is carried as `WebhookEvent.OccurredAt`.
- 8ad33a8: Route `Orders.PreviewPrice` through `OrderPricingService` (the same walk save and `Orders.PriceOrder` use) instead of calling `ResolvePrice` directly. Price resolution now loads rules from every in-force list assigned to the customer, so a member list cannot lose to catalog `BCP-STD` when both assignments are Priority 0.
- 6367347: Restore local definitions of the identity-claim driver contracts so the repo builds against
  published MemberJunction again.

  `orders-core-entities-server` imported `BaseIdentityClaimDriver`, `ClaimContext`,
  `ClaimRedeemContext` and `ClaimResult` from `@memberjunction/core-entities`, and
  `EscapeSQLString` from `@memberjunction/global`. None of those five symbols exist in any
  published MJ package — verified against `6.1.0-edge.3`, the newest published edge and the version
  the lockfile pins, whose tarballs contain no occurrence of any of them (`@memberjunction/global`
  ships `Escape` and `EscapeHTML`). The imports resolved only for developers dev-linked to an MJ
  working tree, so CI failed with ten TS2305 errors, the package did not compile, and three test
  suites could not load at all — `EntitlementGrantClaimDriver`, `GuestOrderClaimDriver`, and
  `registry-parity`, the last of which imports the package by name and takes its 76 checks down with
  it. `Class extends value undefined` was the `@RegisterClass`/`extends` on an undefined import.

  The contracts now live in `identityClaimContracts.ts` and `EscapeSQLString` in `sql-guards.ts`,
  both marked as fallbacks with the deletion steps in their headers. Keeping the contracts in one
  module rather than inline per driver means the eventual swap back is a specifier change at four
  import sites, and any drift between this shape and the published one surfaces as a compile error
  at exactly those sites.

  `CLAUDE.md`'s SQL-safety rule mandated the `@memberjunction/global` import that caused half of
  this, so it now points at `sql-guards.ts` and says why.

  No behaviour change: 1235 unit tests pass, up from 989 running with 3 suites dead.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c094b64: Add `CustomerPaymentTerms` — the terms a particular buyer negotiated

  Date-effective and optionally scoped to one selling company, keyed on organization or person the way
  `CustomerTaxExemption` and `CustomerPaymentMethod` already are. Not an IS-A extension of
  `AccountingCompanyProfile`: that profile IS-A `Company` and describes the SELLER, whereas a buyer
  here is an Organization or a Person — there is nothing to extend.

  Seeds the six standard `PaymentTermsType` rows the walk resolves against; the table had none.

- 7d04b06: Upgrade MemberJunction from 5.50 to 6.1.0-edge.1, and declare four dependencies that were resolving
  by accident.

  The upgrade itself is clean: none of the APIs removed in 6.x — `BeginISATransaction` /
  `CommitISATransaction` / `RollbackISATransaction`, `BaseEntity.ProviderTransaction`,
  `PropagateTransactionToParents()` — had a single call site here. The 21 `BeginTransaction()` sites
  use the depth-counted primitive that survives and is now what IS-A chains use too.

  All five repos move together because `BaseEntity` became generic in 6.x (`BaseEntity<unknown>`), so
  a package still on 5.x consuming an entity class built against 6.x fails to compile.

  **Four undeclared dependencies surfaced**, each previously satisfied by a stale repo-level
  `node_modules` left over from a pre-workspace `npm install`. Once that hoisting was removed they
  stopped resolving, which is the correct behaviour and would have broken any standalone consumer too:

  - `@memberjunction/actions`, `@memberjunction/actions-base` and `@memberjunction/templates` are
    imported by `packages/Server` (the invoice, payment-intent and send-document actions) and were
    declared nowhere. Added as peer dependencies, matching that package's convention for MJ packages.
  - `@angular/cdk` is imported by the workspace tab strip in `packages/Angular` and was declared
    nowhere. Added as a peer at the `>=21.0.0 <22.0.0` range the rest of the workspace uses.

  Also declares `vitest` at the repo root, where `vitest.config.ts` lives. It was declared only in
  individual packages, so the repo-wide suite could not be launched from the root.

  Verified: 31 packages build clean, and the full unit suite passes — 39 files, 1062 tests.

- c094b64: Resolve and store `OrderHeader.DueDate` from payment terms (D83)

  Nothing derived a due date. `DueDate` was only ever what a caller passed, `PaymentTermsType` had no
  rows, and `Orders.GetOverdueWorklist` returned zero rows against 67 orders carrying an unpaid
  balance — a collections screen reporting a quiet afternoon because its only input was null on every
  row.

  Adds a resolution walk (the third of this shape after GL accounts and price): stated `DueDate` →
  stated `PaymentTermsTypeID` → the buyer's `CustomerPaymentTerms` → the selling company's
  `AccountingCompanyProfile.DefaultPaymentTermsTypeID` (which existed and nothing read) → due on
  receipt. Resolved once at confirm and STORED, so aging, the worklist and the invoice all read one
  date instead of deriving three.

  Terms are deliberately not per-product: they are a property of the deal, and an order carrying a
  Net 30 and a Net 60 product has no coherent answer.

- 78ae16a: Lift the pricing walk out of `OrderEntityServer` into `OrderPricingService`, and expose it as
  `Orders.PriceOrder` so a whole order can be priced without saving it.

  The walk — resolve each line's price, then promotions, then charges, then tax — was private methods
  on the entity reading its own fields. That meant the UI could not ask what an order would cost
  without saving one, and `Orders.PreviewPrice` could only answer for a single line, which its own
  description admits is advisory: promotions stack against ORDER totals, charges apportion ACROSS
  lines, and tax computes on the discounted amount.

  Now one implementation with two callers. `OrderEntityServer.Save()` prices before it persists;
  `Orders.PriceOrder` prices and persists nothing. The operation's input mirrors the entity shape
  rather than being a DTO, so the object the client prices is the object it later saves.

  Also adds section mapping to `OrderHeaderEntity` — which editing section a validation failure belongs
  to. Metadata-only logic, so the browser gets it without a round trip.

- c094b64: Enforce the order lifecycle: guard illegal status transitions in `OrderEntityServer.Save`

  `CK_OrderHeader_Status` enforced the legal SET of statuses and nothing enforced the legal MOVES.
  `Fulfilled → Draft` saved. `Voided → Confirmed` saved — a voided order could come back to life,
  keep the journal entries its reversal had already unwound, and be shipped, with every row valid and
  the constraint satisfied.

  New `OrderStatusBehavior` owns the transition table and the predicates six modules previously spelled
  out as ad-hoc string sets that had drifted apart (one of them guarded against `Cancelled`/`Canceled`,
  which are not legal order statuses at all). The guard runs in `Save`, the one path every write goes
  through, and refuses with a reason rather than a bare `false`.

- 3c2b404: Move payment allocations onto a related-record collection, and let the graph write them.

  `Payment Headers → Payment Lines` is declared as `RelatedRecordCollection` metadata, so `Lines`
  exists on both tiers. `PaymentHeaderEntityServer` drops its `_lines` array and its `savePendingLines`
  loop entirely: a payment's allocations are complete when they arrive — the caller supplies them,
  whether that is manual entry, an order's initial payment or a reversal — and the gateway has already
  settled by then, so there is nothing left to decide and no reason to keep ownership of the write.

  The graph does it better than the loop it replaces: removals run before inserts, and the foreign key
  is stamped at execution time, so it is correct even though the header's key is minted by that same
  save.

  No `Sequence` policy, unlike order lines: an allocation is identified by which order line it pays,
  not by position, and `PaymentLine` has no line-number column.

  `AllocatedAt` is now defaulted before the header save rather than during the line loop. It is
  `NOT NULL` and no caller is required to author it, so companion validation — which runs from the
  parent's save, before any line's own `Save()` — would otherwise reject allocations from every caller
  that relied on the fallback.

- 49d9ef3: Promotion codes, charges and manual discounts can reach the engine from a browser again. They were transient arrays only the server could fill, so when `OrderDraft` was deleted the wire went with it: a code or a charge entered on screen was priced into the preview and then silently dropped at confirm, and the customer was billed a number the screen never showed. Charges and adjustments are now related-record collections — a client stages the row it is asking for and the engine completes it — and promotion codes are an `EntityCompanion`, because a code has no child row of its own and only the engine can turn one into an `OrderAdjustment`. Also fixes `ORDER_ENTITY = 'MJ_BizApps_Orders: Orders'`, an entity name that does not exist, used by every new-order and open-order path in the workspace. `MJOOrderEntryService` is now `MJOPricingScheduler` and holds only the debounce and the out-of-order guard; `SaveOrThrow`, `Confirm` and `LoadWithLines` moved onto `OrderHeaderEntity` where a non-Angular host can reach them.
- 6e8eba0: The pricing engine moves into the browser-safe package and the price strip runs it locally. `OrderPricingService`, `PriceResolver`, `PromotionEngine`, `TaxResolver`, `ChargeEngine`, `OrdersEngine` and the three behaviour modules — 3,716 lines — always could run on either tier: they use `RunView`, `IMetadataProvider` and `MJGlobal` and nothing else. They sat in the server package by convention, and that convention was the only thing making a price preview cost a round trip. An order with no promotion code and no custom pricing plugin now prices with no server call at all, from the SAME code the booking walk runs. Anything a plugin decides, or any promotion code, escalates to `Orders.PriceOrder` — plugins are server-side code the browser's class factory does not have, and redemption caps change with orders other people are placing.
- 389a381: Move order lines onto an MJ 6.1 related-record collection, and split the order rules across the two
  tiers.

  `Lines` is now declared as `EntityRelationship.RelatedRecordCollection` metadata, so CodeGen emits a
  typed accessor onto the GENERATED entity class and both tiers have it. That replaces a `_lines`
  array with a getter/setter pair that existed only on the server, and it is what lets the browser
  compose an order and ship the whole graph in one call.

  Adds `OrderHeaderEntity`, a shared client+server subclass holding every rule decidable without the
  database — the status-transition guard, the must-have-a-payer rule and the must-have-something-to-book
  rule — so the browser refuses those before a round trip and every other caller still gets them.
  `OrderStatusBehavior` moved down to the entities package with it (it was pure, with zero imports).

  Also fixes a cross-repo break: `AccountingCompanyProfile.DefaultPaymentTermsTypeID` was removed by
  bizapps-accounting (their issue #22, on the correct grounds that payment terms are an orders
  concern), and orders kept reading it — so every order whose customer had no negotiated terms failed
  the company-default step of the due-date walk. The column now lives on `OrderCompanyPolicy`.

  `ExpectedGrossTotal` on `Orders.ConfirmOrder` is now enforced. It was accepted and read by nothing.

- b6031e2: Remove `OrderDraft` and the four remote operations that existed only to carry it. `Orders.SaveOrder`, `Orders.ConfirmOrder`, `Orders.PreviewOrder` and `Orders.PreviewConfirm` are gone — composing and booking an order is `order.Save()` through MJ 6.1's entity graph, and pricing without writing is `Orders.PriceOrder`. `Orders.CreateOrderInState` is renamed to `Orders.AdvanceOrderState` and now takes an `OrderHeaderID`: it starts where the save finishes, and refuses an order that never booked rather than producing one that reads Fulfilled with no ledger behind it. A migration deletes the retired operation rows, because `mj sync push` only reconciles rows it is given and would leave them Active with no code behind them.
- c094b64: Retire `RevenueRecognitionSchedule`, `RevRecScheduleLine` and `OrderLine.RevenueRecognitionScheduleID` (D84)

  Kept as "the computed envelope for MRR/ARR display and the computation trail", and never written by
  anything — 14 lines in the review seed carry a deferred recognition type and none had a schedule.

  Both purposes are already served by what recognition actually produces. The releases ARE a schedule:
  forward-dated, balanced and queryable in `JournalEntry`/`JournalEntryLine`, and the trail is those
  entries plus `OrderLinePriceComponent`. A second copy of the same facts is free to drift, and empty
  tables that look authoritative are worse than absent ones — a report writer finds them and assumes
  they are the source of truth. Forecasting belongs in an FP&A layer, not beside the ledger.

  Revenue recognition itself is unchanged; `RevenueRecognitionType` and the forward-dated entries stay.

### Patch Changes

- 319f76e: A booked order can no longer add, remove, or reprice lines, or restate the initial tender. Validate refuses those edits, the form hides the catalog picker, and the unused Fast Entry page is removed.
- c094b64: Correct CI's stale figures and stop claiming changesets are enforced

  The workflow described 217 integration checks and 250 unit tests; there are 366 and 999.
  `migrations/_README.md` said a changeset was required "(CI enforces)" — there was no changeset
  tooling in the repo at all, and the claim sat unenforced through several schema changes. The rule
  above it claimed migration timestamps were CI-enforced too; no such check has ever existed either.
  Both now state what is true, which is that they are review items.

  Adds `@changesets/cli` configured against this repo's `next` trunk, and an ADVISORY warning
  annotation on pull requests. Advisory rather than a gate on purpose: a red X on a documentation PR
  with no version impact is a check people learn to ignore.

- b32c32a: Confirm-after-draft loads Lines and writes them before Status flips.

  A GraphQL form save reloads the header only. Changing Status to Confirmed then
  walked an empty collection, created no membership term, and EvenOverTime
  refused. Existing draft lines were then UPDATEd after the header was already
  Confirmed, so trigger 51003 rolled back inside INSERT-EXEC.

  `OrderHeaderEntity.EnsureLinesLoaded` is the shared read. The server persists
  prorated line money while the header is still Draft, then flips Status.

- 4cbd90e: Read date cells through `ToISODate` instead of `String(cell).slice(0, 10)`, which yields
  `'Thu Jul 30'` for a `Date` and compares as less than nothing. Fixes two all-zero dashboard charts,
  a year column reading `'Mon '`, and an expired tax-exemption certificate that never warned.
- fad54cb: PaymentDetail is an owner-held 1:1 embed on the wallet, payment header, and order intent FK. Booking and capture skip related collections so the detail persists with the header.
- 1d23637: A new Draft with no lines now mints OrderNumber instead of failing the insert. Subscriptions consume accounting-ng's deferred-revenue waterfall (the 3-column stub is gone) and label the rail Terms. Event-line extensions reload CompanyID/UnitPrice from the saved parent after the graph returns.
- 5b379d1: Fix four money and subscription defects found by stressing the UI

  Twenty-six adversarial orders were designed with their expected results written BEFORE running them,
  then driven through the real UI and checked against the database. Four defects survived that, and
  none would have been found by reading the code.

  **A flat price billed the wrong amount.** A `Flat` rule's total was reconstructed as
  `quantity × derived_rate`, so three of a 100.00 flat pack billed **99.99** — a flat amount that
  cannot be represented as a unit rate loses money on every sale. `LineGross` is now the single
  definition of a line's gross, shared by all six consumers, and takes the exact extended amount the
  pricing pass computed rather than re-deriving it. Booked lines short-circuit entirely, because their
  money is frozen by trigger 51003 and any figure that cannot be reproduced from stored state alone
  would fail the confirm.

  **Two lines for one subscription created two subscriptions** instead of extending one — duplicate
  billing and a customer holding two overlapping terms.

  **Subscriptions booked to the order header's company**, not the line's, putting the wrong company on
  the ledger for any multi-company order.

  **`OrderLine.SubscriptionID` was never written back**, so the link existed in one direction only —
  which is also what hid the duplicate-subscription bug from the first validator, which reported "no
  subscriptions" and passed a broken order.

  Also refuses products that are discontinued or outside their sale window at confirm, tested against
  the ORDER's date rather than today's.

- 79bb2b3: A check number typed on Fast Entry never reached confirm.

  `InitialPaymentTypeID` and `InitialPaymentAmount` are columns and already crossed
  the wire. The reference is not a column — it lives on `PaymentDetail` after
  confirm — so both screens kept it as page state. The server only looked at
  `InitialPaymentDetailID`, which Fast Entry never set, and refused with
  "Check payments need a reference number".

  The typed number now rides `Order.InitialPaymentReference` (a companion, like
  promotion codes). Confirm creates the `PaymentDetail` from it and attaches that
  to the payment.

- 25c6b24: Declare BUSL-1.1 in mj-app.json. The LICENSE file and every package
  already state BUSL-1.1; the app manifest still said ISC, so anything
  reading the manifest saw the wrong license.
- 797303e: Move to MemberJunction 6.1.0-edge.3, and make `orders-ng` loadable by Node.

  The workspace was on a half-applied edge.2 line: `@memberjunction/ng-hierarchy-tree` was pinned to
  `6.1.0-edge.2` while the peer ranges asked for `^6.1.0-edge.1`, and the two `@mj-biz-apps/common-*`
  dependencies were pinned to `5.33.2`, which predates the components this package imports. Both now
  point at versions that exist and agree: MJ at `6.1.0-edge.3`, common at `>=5.35.0`.

  `orders-ng` shipped ESM that only a bundler could load. It declares `"type": "module"`, but its
  build was `ngc` alone — and `tsconfig.angular.json` sets `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`, which
  permits extensionless relative specifiers and emits them verbatim. Node's ESM resolver rejects
  those, so `import('@mj-biz-apps/orders-ng')` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` naming a file that
  was present in the package. 274 of the 346 relative specifiers in `dist` were affected, 19 of them
  emitted by ngc itself for template component references, which no source-level change can reach.

  The fix is the one the rest of this workspace already used: run `tsc-alias -f`
  (`--resolveFullPaths`) after the build. The other five `orders-*` packages build with
  `tsc && tsc-alias -f` and have zero extensionless specifiers; the Angular package builds with `ngc`
  and was the only one that skipped it. Adding it takes `dist` to 0 extensionless and 0 unresolvable
  specifiers with no source changes.

  Test-side, eight Angular suites could not load at all, and had been invisible while CI was failing
  earlier in the job. Same root cause, in dependencies rather than here: every BizApps `*-ng` package
  has this defect (`accounting-ng` 218 specifiers, `common-ng` 81, `tasks-ng` 64). `vitest.config.ts`
  now inlines those so Vite resolves them instead of Node — the real modules stay in the graph, so
  unlike the `accounting-engine-base` alias beside it, nothing is stubbed and the class-registration
  assertions still test real registrations.

  Verified: 31 packages build clean; 64 test files, 1232 tests pass.

- 65ebe2c: GL account resolution now walks product → category → product type → company, and
  ORD-WORLD seeds the accounts, dimensions, and company-level AR links a confirm needs.

  Booking also force-refreshes the accounting engine so MJAPI sees links written by
  ORD-00 in another process, instead of reporting "No GL account is linked for role
  Accounts Receivable" against a company that already has the link.

- f4cce15: State the overdue rule once, in `overdue.ts`, and have `GetOverdueWorklist` read it. Three surfaces
  derived it independently and only one excluded a voided order — so a voided order with a stale
  balance appeared on collections lists as money owed.
- 65b60a9: Default price/tax/secret resolvers are intentionally registered with no ClassFactory key. Mark those registrations so Explorer/MJAPI stop warning at boot, and probe for a plugin key before CreateInstance so the walk does not fall back (and warn) on every Product/Category/Company miss.
- 75b331e: Stamp JournalEntryID on the Order Line parent and skip re-saving a clean IS-A line extension. Confirming an event order no longer fails with Field OrderHeader does not exist on Event Order Lines.
