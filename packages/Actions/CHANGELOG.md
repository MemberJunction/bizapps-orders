### Minor Changes

- 7d04b06: Upgrade MemberJunction from 5.50 to 6.1.0-edge.1, and declare four dependencies that were resolving
  by accident.

  The upgrade itself is clean: none of the APIs removed in 6.x — `BeginISATransaction` /
  `CommitISATransaction` / `RollbackISATransaction`, `BaseEntity.ProviderTransaction`,
  `PropagateTransactionToParents()` — had a single call site here. The 21 `BeginTransaction()` sites
  use the depth-counted primitive that survives and is now what IS-A chains use too.

  All five repos move together because `BaseEntity` became generic in 6.x (`BaseEntity<unknown>`), so
  a package still on 5.x consuming an entity class built against 6.x fails to compile.

  **Four undeclared dependencies surfaced**, each previously satisfied by a stale repo-level
  `node_modules` left over from a pre-workspace `npm install`. Once that hoisting was removed they
  stopped resolving, which is the correct behaviour and would have broken any standalone consumer too:

  - `@memberjunction/actions`, `@memberjunction/actions-base` and `@memberjunction/templates` are
    imported by `packages/Server` (the invoice, payment-intent and send-document actions) and were
    declared nowhere. Added as peer dependencies, matching that package's convention for MJ packages.
  - `@angular/cdk` is imported by the workspace tab strip in `packages/Angular` and was declared
    nowhere. Added as a peer at the `>=21.0.0 <22.0.0` range the rest of the workspace uses.

  Also declares `vitest` at the repo root, where `vitest.config.ts` lives. It was declared only in
  individual packages, so the repo-wide suite could not be launched from the root.

  Verified: 31 packages build clean, and the full unit suite passes — 39 files, 1062 tests.

### Patch Changes

- 5b379d1: Move the invoice, payment-intent and document-send actions into the server package

  They lived in `orders-actions` but depend on server-side entity behaviour, so the order → journal
  entry path could not be reached end to end from a running instance. Relocating them alongside the
  code they call makes that path reachable; the action bodies are unchanged.

- 25c6b24: Declare BUSL-1.1 in mj-app.json. The LICENSE file and every package
  already state BUSL-1.1; the app manifest still said ISC, so anything
  reading the manifest saw the wrong license.
- 797303e: Move to MemberJunction 6.1.0-edge.3, and make `orders-ng` loadable by Node.

  The workspace was on a half-applied edge.2 line: `@memberjunction/ng-hierarchy-tree` was pinned to
  `6.1.0-edge.2` while the peer ranges asked for `^6.1.0-edge.1`, and the two `@mj-biz-apps/common-*`
  dependencies were pinned to `5.33.2`, which predates the components this package imports. Both now
  point at versions that exist and agree: MJ at `6.1.0-edge.3`, common at `>=5.35.0`.

  `orders-ng` shipped ESM that only a bundler could load. It declares `"type": "module"`, but its
  build was `ngc` alone — and `tsconfig.angular.json` sets `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`, which
  permits extensionless relative specifiers and emits them verbatim. Node's ESM resolver rejects
  those, so `import('@mj-biz-apps/orders-ng')` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` naming a file that
  was present in the package. 274 of the 346 relative specifiers in `dist` were affected, 19 of them
  emitted by ngc itself for template component references, which no source-level change can reach.

  The fix is the one the rest of this workspace already used: run `tsc-alias -f`
  (`--resolveFullPaths`) after the build. The other five `orders-*` packages build with
  `tsc && tsc-alias -f` and have zero extensionless specifiers; the Angular package builds with `ngc`
  and was the only one that skipped it. Adding it takes `dist` to 0 extensionless and 0 unresolvable
  specifiers with no source changes.

  Test-side, eight Angular suites could not load at all, and had been invisible while CI was failing
  earlier in the job. Same root cause, in dependencies rather than here: every BizApps `*-ng` package
  has this defect (`accounting-ng` 218 specifiers, `common-ng` 81, `tasks-ng` 64). `vitest.config.ts`
  now inlines those so Vite resolves them instead of Node — the real modules stay in the graph, so
  unlike the `accounting-engine-base` alias beside it, nothing is stubbed and the class-registration
  assertions still test real registrations.

  Verified: 31 packages build clean; 64 test files, 1232 tests pass.
